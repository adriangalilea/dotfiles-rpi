# Project Checklist

This checklist serves as an index of all tasks for the project, both completed and pending. It provides a comprehensive overview of the project's progress and remaining work. For day-to-day task management, we use the checklist-current.md file as a Kanban board, which focuses on immediate and upcoming tasks.
