# Yazi

## idea for navigation

<kbd>/</kbd> for "search"

Allows you to fzf inside the folder, when only 1 item OR you want to move into the currently selected one on this mode you press <kbd>/</kbd> and you get into the folder/file

The search filtering occurs in the HEADER not in the popup as it is occurring now.

> How can I make this work like fzf / broot ?

- Ideally yazi UI remains when static but rather than morphing into a full fledged fzf like when you press <kbd>z</kbd> it should stay with a semblance of yazi that allows you to fzf/broot

Two shortcuts may work for the 2 different flows, maybe: <kbd>/</kbd> <kbd>\\</kbd>
