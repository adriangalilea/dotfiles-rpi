# RPi dotfiles

[This git repo is meant to be used as home `~`.](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html)

This repo is an attempt to have sane defaults for the various rpi's I have, the idea is to run the main.py as a boot script and have the very same environment in every rpi I flash.

Heavily inspired by [@sobolevn](https://github.com/sobolevn) [dotfiles](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles) with many modifications, also merged my own dotfiles, tailored for the RPi's.

Assumes aarch64.

```
¬ª dif -h                                                                                                            
Usage: dif <file1> <file2>
Compare two files or URLs, including GitHub repositories.

Supported formats:
  - Local files
  - GitHub shorthand: git:{repo}:{[optional, default=main/master]branch}:{filepath}
    ex: git:adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi:.shell/.aliases
  - GitHub regular URLs: https://github.com/adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi/blob/master/.shell/.aliases
  - GitHub raw URLs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi/master/.shell/.aliases

Examples:
  1. Compare local file to GitHub shorthand:
     dif ~/.shell/.aliases git:adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi:.shell/.aliases

  2. Compare two GitHub repositories using shorthand:
     dif git:adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi:.shell/.aliases git:sobolevn/dotfiles:shell/.aliases

  3. Compare GitHub shorthand to GitHub regular URL:
     dif git:adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi:.shell/.completions https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/.completions

  4. Compare local file to GitHub raw URL:
     dif ~/.shell/.completions https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/master/shell/.completions

  5. Compare GitHub regular URL to GitHub raw URL:
     dif https://github.com/adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi/blob/master/.shell/.aliases https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/master/shell/.aliases

  6. Compare two local files:
     dif ~/.shell/.aliases ~/.shell/.completions

  7. Compare GitHub shorthand with specific branch to GitHub regular URL:
     dif git:adriangalilea/dotfiles-rpi:main:.shell/.aliases https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/.aliases

# [@self] SSH Configuration Instructions

> [!NOTE]  
> This is meant so that I can push from the device to github repo's may not be necessary or desired by you.

To configure SSH for seamless Git operations with GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Generate SSH Keys:**

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "adriangalilea"
```

2. **Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:**

```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

3. **Add SSH Key to GitHub:**
  ```sh
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pu
  ```

   Copy the key and add it to your GitHub account:
   - GitHub: [Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key](https://github.com/settings/keys)

# TO-DO

## main

- [ ] feat: github-rsolver or `gr`
- [ ] feat: alias that executes `~/.setup/main.sh` for convenience on first git pull
- [ ] refactor: all github installs into [`dra`](https://github.com/devmatteini/dra)
- [ ] chore: test install from scratch
- [ ] chore: move all `pip` installs into `pipx`
- [ ] feat: shell prompt that has username + hostname IF ssh session, otherwise username
- [ ] add: `direnv`
- [ ] add: `markdown-oxide` lsp for hx
- [ ] add: `calcurse`
- [ ] fix `zoxide` not behaving right if set in alias as `cd` 
- [ ] consider if [sdm](https://github.com/gitbls/sdm) or hijacking the script.sh(rpi imager) is a better option to run the `setup.sh`
- [ ] improve installing output:
```
